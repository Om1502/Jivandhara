This proposed Blood Bank Management System gives a reliable platform for both donors and acceptors. The Jivandhara(BMMS) is a web-based application that helps to minimize human errors and problems pertaining to data redundancy.
Features include product oriented data input, inventory control , product utilization , contacting for blood.
The web application provides a way of communication and synchronization between the hospitals and the blood banks. It also provides them with the facility of communicating with the nearby donors in emergency. 
The database is a vital aspect of the system.



     So mainly at user interface our system has 3 main modules that are Home , Login , Register.
1] Home:
       In this module all the functionalities about user interface has been provided for reliability in the use of this system. Using all that functions user can able to do his task whether to search for blood or register as donor and many other things.

1.1.Search :
         So , On the Home page we are provided our most useful objective that is search option box or field where any user who want to search blood group will be have search option . He can search by two way, Either by Blood group which is required or by donor name. So For searching user don’t have compulsion to register.

1.2.Register :
       So after searching user have find the donor and the required blood group then he has to register himself/herself for further process. After registering , his details get saved in the database which will be shown at the bank dashboard and bank has all the authority whether to edit any changes in the details or delete the user.
So for registration the following details has to submit:
        1)Name                                  5)Phone no
        2)Address                               6)Email id
        3)City                                     7) Password
        4) Postal code                  

2] Login :
         After registering on the application, user can login into his account. So for maintaining security we have given option of password using which user allow to login into his account.
So for login email id and password has to be required. After login user can access his account and see the notification or the further history.

 2.1.Myprofile :
     Under this tab user get special option where he can allow to send a blood request for other registered donors. He can send number of requests for various number of donors registered in the database. So at the time of sending request just we want to choose the donor and click on the contact for blood option then a text box will came where the address need to be submit.
 
 2.2.Notification :
    Under this tab user came to know about whether he get requested for blood by other or not , If yes then notification will be present their having the name of the requested person.
 
 2.3. Logout:  So this is used to logout from the account.
  the Blood bank dashboard which will be the main thing or core part of this blood bank management system . For maintaining all the records of donors and recipients details as well as other things we have created very user friendly dashboard for simplify this work.

1)Blood stock:
So in this dashboard the main home page represent all the blood stock available in the blood bank according to different blood groups. Means all the data about blood count get sorted blood groupwise for maintenance of blood. Also it get changed as the new entry for blood has been registered or any blood entry get dispatched. So it is automated and get maintain easily.
In this system we are maintaining the blood stock in the pints which means 300ml of blood .

2)Database :
 Also this dashboard has given database of donors who have been registered on the application on the user interface side. All that entries are visible over here and can be modified or deleted from here . Also blood bank administrator can able send the request for blood from this dashboard as well.

3)Donations details :
     For maintaining the blood stock and maintain the count blood bank administrator has to fill some details about each donor who have donated the blood to blood bank . So that form has various fields which will be again shown on the dashboard of blood bank.
So that fields are as follows:
1) Blood group                        5) weight
2)Name                                   6) Email
3)Gender                                 7) Phone no
4)qty
